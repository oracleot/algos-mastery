# Specification Quality Checklist: Timed Practice Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 1 January 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items passed on first review
- The spec covers 4 distinct user stories with clear priorities (P1-P4)
- 22 functional requirements defined across 4 feature areas
- 7 measurable success criteria established
- Edge cases addressed: infinite loops, large output, navigation during fullscreen, timer completion in fullscreen
- Assumptions documented for sandboxed execution, timeout limits, and existing timer hook compatibility
